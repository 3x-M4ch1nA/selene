Selene - A SSL/TLS library

Selene has a few goals that makes it different from a more traditional 
SSL libraries:

  * Completely Asynchronous: Selene does no IO itself, it only provides
    notifications to the user that IO should be done.

  * Asynchronous Callbacks: Callback functions provide their own callback
    to notify Selene when the user has finished an operation.

  * Test Driven: A test framework to test all code paths.

  * Plugable Backends for Cryptography: Currently only focusing
    on OpenSSL, but others are possible.

  * Liberal License: Under the Apache Software License 2.0

Hacking Notes:
  * External Functions and types are prefixed with selene_*
  * Internal Functions and types are prefixed with sln_*
  * 2 Spaces, httpd-ish style C.
  * Write test cases for all code paths, including errors.
